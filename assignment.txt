All assignments must be done individually unless stated 
otherwise.You are encouraged to discuss with your classmates 
about the given assignments, but these discussions related
to a particular solution to a specific problem (either in
actuall code or in the pseudocode)will not be tolerated.
In short, turning in someonr else's work, in whole or in part,
as your own will be considerednas a violation of
academic integrrity. Please note that the former condition 
also holds for the material found on the web as everything 
on the web has been written by someone else.
I acknowledge that i have fully read and understood the 
contents of the course;I will not share my work (not even a part of it)
on telegram ;I understand that if i have any questions or
concerns about thr course mechanics, it is my responsibility
to discuss them with the instructors whitin their office hours.
